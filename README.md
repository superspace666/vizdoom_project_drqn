# vizdoom_project_drqn
#### The code of my project: Playing Vizdoom Game Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
##### Implemented a simple DQN for the navigation network and a DRQN augmented with game features for the action network
##### Solution feasibility is verified in the Vizdoom environment. With reward shaping, frame skipping, sequential updating, and curriculum learning, the networks I train can handle the navigation and shoot in the Vizdoom game.
##### Future work is working on a mobile robot and setting up a visual navigation system.
